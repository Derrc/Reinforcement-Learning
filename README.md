# Reinforcement-Learning
Exploring and implementing different Reinforcement Learning algorithms to better my understanding.

Value-Based, Policy-Based, Actor-Critic Methods, Deterministic Policy Gradient Methods.

# TODO
1. SARSA, SARSA(λ), Q-Learning, DQN
2. Reinforce, Reinforce with Baseline
3. Advantage Actor-Critic for TD(0)/TD(λ)
4. Natural Policy Gradient, TRPO, PPO
5. DPG, DDPG, TD3
6. Soft Actor-Critic
7. A3C/A2C implementations
